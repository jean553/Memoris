# Memoris

![Image 1](github/readme.png)

Taiga taskboard : https://tree.taiga.io/project/jean553-memoris/

Memoris is a C++ 14 video game developed using the SFML. The main goal is to move a pin on a grid of cells, from the departure to the arrival.
The player has to find all the stars on the map before going to the arrival cell. The whole map is only visible a few seconds before the game
starts and all the cells are suddently hidden. The player has to "memorize" the cells disposition before playing.

The map is full of bonus, lifes, additional time... but also malus ! The player has to find all the stars and the arrival before the countdown
finishes.

There are also many events cell on the map that move the disposition of the cells : symmetry effects, teleportation, walls, floors switch... etc...

**NOTE: this work is in progress. Some features are not implemented yet, some of them are partially implemented.**
